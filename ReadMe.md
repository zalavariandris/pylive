# Introduction

This repo is a personal monorepo with projects in a very(!) early experimental stage.


## Background
I am a mainly an artist. Graduated at _The Hungarian University of Fine Arts_
as a painter. Later I finished my doctoral studies, and wrote a dissertation
at the University titled _Depth is another Width: The Models of Vision_.

Since the begining of my studies, I have been using various media, from
traditional drawing and painting, sculptures etc. Later I made videos,
software based installations.
My artist workflow, is usually defined by loosely defined conditions and rules,
that build the final results.

I also work in the VFX industry as a compositor and CGI generalist.
I have tried myself on almost every field including compositing, matchmoving,
modelleing, shading and rendering. I used to do a lot of character animation
which I always loved. I also did a lot of technical stuff like rigging,
simulating and always loved tinkering with code.

While working, with a lot of different softwares, from 3dsmax through Maya,
(A little Houdini), Nuke, After effects, 3DEqualizer, PFTracker etc,
I always imagined createing my own lightweight, live coding environment,
that could possibly fit my artist workflow as well as integrate into the
VFX works.

While working with the above mentioned softwares, I fall in love with a node
based aproach. But it also have a donwside. I think nodes are great for an
overal perspective, while coding fits bettter when diving deep into the details.

Here in this repository, I will experiment with live coding environments,
both code, and graph based approach, ideally combining them to choose whatever
fits the actual problem.


## Projects

- _Perspy_ is simple desktop app, for finding the exact camera instrinsics
  and transfrmation from a set of vanishing line.

- _QtGraphEditor_ is an attempt to create a so called View that blends right
  inside the QT Model/View arhitecture.

- _ImSketch_ is a hardly evens started little template for an imgui based live coding environment.
  Also its is supposed to be a template for imgui based experiments
