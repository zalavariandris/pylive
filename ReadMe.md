# Introduction
I am a mainly an artist. Graduated at _The Hungarian University of Fine Arts_
as a painter. Later I finished my doctoral studies, and wrote a dissertation
at the University titled _Depth is another Width: The Models of Vision_.

Since the begining of my studies, I have been using various media, from
traditional drawing and painting, sculptures etc. Later I made videos,
software based installations.
My artist workflow, is usually defined by loosely defined conditions and rules,
that build the final results.

I also work in the VFX industry as a compositor and CGI generalist.
I have tried myself on almost every field including compositing, matchmoving,
modelleing, shading and rendering. I used to do a lot of character animation
which I always loved. I also did a lot of technical stuff like rigging,
simulating and always loved tinkering with code.

While working, with a lot of different softwares, from 3dsmax through Maya,
(A little Houdini), Nuke, After effects, 3DEqualizer, PFTracker etc,
I always imagined createing my own, lightweight live coding environment,
that could possibly fit my artist workflow as well ss integrate into the
VFX works.

While working with the above mentioned softwavers, I fall in love with a node
based aproach. But it alsa have a donwside. I think nodes are great for an
overal perspective, while coding fits bettter when diving deep into the details.

Here in this repository, I will experiment with live coding environments,
both code, and graph based approach, ideally combining them to choose whatever
fits the actual problem.
